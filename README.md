## Overview

The second week was focused on understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. We explored core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The week began with OOP fundamentals and progressed through constructors, access modifiers, and key Java keywords like this, static, and final. We also looked at object modeling with class diagrams, and concluded with an introduction to abstract classes, interfaces, and dynamic behavior through polymorphism.
